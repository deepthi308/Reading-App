Feeling very hungry, he ate whatever roots and herbs he could find and drank from a spring close by. Then, he decided to walk around and explore the place. He heard voices and followed them till he saw a man grazing some horses.

The man explained that he and his friends, who were stable grooms, had brought the horses of King Mihrage for grazing here as they did every year. “We must return to our master tomorrow,” he said asking Sindbad to come with them.

The stable grooms took Sindbad to the court in the city, and explained where they had found him. Sindbad was taken to King Mihrage, whom he found to be extremely gracious; he welcomed Sindbad warmly to his court and his island. He made sure that Sindbad was given every comfort and luxury.

Sindbad repaid his courtesy and hospitality by telling him about his adventure. The King found it very interesting and made Sindbad a guest at his palace.

Sindbad soon went around the city to meet merchants from whom he tried to find out how he could go back to his own land. He found strange things too in this kingdom, such as fascinating island called Cassel guarded by a genie named Deggial! He saw so colourful and strange fish that he had never seen or imagined before! It was a strange land, but he longed for home!

Walking around the city, one day Sindbad reached the harbour. He recognised the merchant loading a ship as being the captain of the ship he had sailed in when he ended up on the whale! And he discovered that there were some of the goods he had carried!

The captain recognised him, too, and was very happy to see him alive. Sindbad told him about all the adventures he had and how much he enjoyed seeing new people and places.

The captain was pleased to return all the goods to Sindbad. Back to being a merchant, Sindbad sold much of his merchandise in the city and when he returned home, he was a rich man.

He built a splendid house for his family and had carriages and many servants. The story of his voyage was over and his guests went away after he had given him gifts too.`,

Their stepmother told their father, “We are dying of hunger, so I will leave the children in the forest tomorrow.”

Hansel heard that discussion. That night, Hansel picked up the shiny stones readily available outside the house. After that, Hansal hid the stones and slept in his room.

The next morning, the stepmother took the children to the forest. Hansel was dropping the pebbles on the land. He thought that we would follow the stones to reach a house.

After an hour, They were in the deep of the forest. The stepmother said, “Wait for me kids near this big tree, I will be here soon.” But she did not return.

You are reading Hansel and Gretel Short Story…..

Hansel and Gretel chased the shining stones and finally reached their home.

Later few days, the stepmother said, “Let’s have an outing in the jungle.”

Gretel began to cry because she knew that her stepmother would leave them again in the jungle. Hensal was worried this time as he did not have time to choose the shiny stones.

However, Hansel picked the bread with himself during trevelling. Hansel was dropping breadcrumbs to the ground so that they can again reach the home by following breadcrumbs. But this time, the birds ate all the breadcrumbs, so they could not find their home.

Both Kids were wandering in the forest here and there. After a few hours, they found a house. The house was made up of cookies and cakes.

Gretel was so excited when she looked that home. Hansel and Gretel ate cookies and cakes.

Suddenly a strange woman came out of the house. She said, “Kids come in and eat delicious food.”

The lady was an evil witch. She laughingly said, “hee, heee, hhe! I’ll eat you, kids!”

She locked Hansel in a cellar. Gretel was now doing the housework of a sorcerer.

One day, the witch was boiling some water to cook the children, but Gretel suddenly pressed the witch into the water.

Witch said,”Oh no!” and she slipped into the boiling water.

Gretel unlocked the cellar door to free Hansel. Hansel and Gretel took the witch’s jewels, and they escaped from there.

Hansel and Gretel located their home where their father was sitting. His father stated, “I am very sorry my kids but your stepmother has gone.”

They constantly lived gladly ever after and spend gems of witch in living a happy life.`,

But one day, the mirror answered that Snow White was the fairest of the Kingdom.

Jealous and angry, The Queen ordered a hunter to kill Snow White. However, the hunter couldn’t kill Snow White, so he left her in the forest.

While wandering around, Snow White found a small house with seven chairs, seven plates, seven beds and so on.

It was the seven Dwarfs’ cottage! When the Dwarfs returned home, they were surprised to find Snow White.

The Dwarfs were so sad. They thought she was dead and put her in a glass coffin.
